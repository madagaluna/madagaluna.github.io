One of a litter of 13 born on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ides_of_March">the Ides of March,</a> <strong>TIMBER</strong> joined our tribe on May 8, 2021.  
<br/>
Before we even met him we picked his name.  Bold, I know.
We had a very long list of names, with the top contenders being: <ol>
<li>Caesar  </li>
<li>Brutus </li>
<li>Monster </li>
<li>Monty </li>
<li>Bandersnatch </li></ol>

<script type = "text/javascript">
name = prompt("What is the very best name for a boy Golden Retriever puppy?:", "");
document.write("You'd name him " +name+"? That's cute, but my favorite is still 'Monster!'") 
</script>
<br/>
Well, as you can imagine, we went back and forth on the names, arguing, needling, negotiating, all to no avail.  We all had our favorites and no one was budging.
<br>
Now, as it happened, one evening we were discussing how we would go about house training our pup. Our youngest suggested we let him use the deck to conduct his business at night.  “But what about the downstairs neighbors?” someone asked.  Not missing a beat, she replied, “We’ll just yell, “Timber”” and a name was born.

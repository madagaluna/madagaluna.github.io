Whatâ€™s it mean to be a COVID pup? 
 <ul><br/> 
<li>It means you know a lot of other pups at the park because a lot of people decided to get a COVID pup.</li>
<li>It means people are home with you all day everyday </li>
<li>It means you hit adolescence about a month ago and are <strong> a complete nutball</strong> right now! </li></ul> <br/>
With everyone home all day every day, Timber and I escape into the great outdoors! <br/></br>
